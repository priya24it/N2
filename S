The D1944 story is not explicitly defined as QA-labeled, but after reviewing the story, I have identified several potential test cases. Can I create a test case task for this story?

Additionally, while writing the test cases, I need clarification on the following:

1. When performing subscriptions from different vendors, does either the ETL cycle or the ETL file processing table contain an indicator that specifies the vendor?


2. Based on my research, errors are typically logged in an error table when invalid messages are received from a topic. Do we have such an error table in our system?


3. Regarding Pub/Sub downtime recovery: I assume these scenarios are extremely edge cases. Can we confirm whether the following cases are valid?
