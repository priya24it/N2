Here are some test cases for BigQuery slots to ensure efficient utilization, proper allocation, and overall performance for different scenarios:

1. Slot Allocation and Utilization Tests

Test Case 1.1: Default Slot Allocation
	•	Objective: Verify that queries automatically use shared slots in on-demand pricing.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Run a simple SQL query on a small dataset.
	2.	Monitor the slot allocation in the BigQuery Admin Console.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Slots are dynamically allocated and released after query execution.

Test Case 1.2: Reserved Slot Utilization
	•	Objective: Validate that reserved slots are used for assigned workloads.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Reserve 500 slots for a specific project or job.
	2.	Run a heavy query in that project.
	3.	Monitor slot utilization using Cloud Monitoring or the Admin Console.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Reserved slots are utilized for the query, and other projects cannot use these slots.

2. Query Prioritization Tests

Test Case 2.1: High Priority Query
	•	Objective: Ensure high-priority queries are given preference in slot allocation.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Run a low-priority long-running query that uses most of the slots.
	2.	Simultaneously run a high-priority query.
	3.	Monitor the high-priority query’s execution.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	The high-priority query executes faster and preempts low-priority queries.

Test Case 2.2: Low Priority Query Delay
	•	Objective: Verify that low-priority queries are delayed if slots are fully utilized.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Reserve a fixed number of slots.
	2.	Run several high-priority queries to occupy all slots.
	3.	Execute a low-priority query.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	The low-priority query waits for available slots before execution.

3. Performance and Scalability Tests

Test Case 3.1: High Slot Utilization
	•	Objective: Test how BigQuery performs under heavy workload with all reserved slots utilized.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Reserve 1,000 slots.
	2.	Run multiple complex queries simultaneously until all slots are occupied.
	3.	Monitor query execution time and slot usage.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Queries execute without errors, and slots are fully utilized.

Test Case 3.2: Over-Provisioning Test
	•	Objective: Validate that unused reserved slots do not impact query execution.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Reserve 500 slots.
	2.	Run a small query that requires fewer than 50 slots.
	3.	Monitor slot utilization and query execution time.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Query executes efficiently, and unused slots remain idle.

4. Error Handling Tests

Test Case 4.1: Slot Over-Utilization in On-Demand Mode
	•	Objective: Verify how BigQuery handles queries that require more slots than available.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Run multiple large queries simultaneously in on-demand mode.
	2.	Monitor query execution time and errors (if any).
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Queries execute without failure, but execution time may increase due to slot contention.

Test Case 4.2: Slot Contention in Reserved Mode
	•	Objective: Ensure proper error handling when reserved slots are fully utilized.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Reserve a fixed number of slots.
	2.	Run queries that consume all reserved slots.
	3.	Submit additional queries.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Additional queries wait in the queue until slots are available, and no queries fail.

5. Slot Reservation Tests

Test Case 5.1: Multiple Reservations
	•	Objective: Validate that multiple slot reservations are isolated.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Create two reservations: 500 slots for ETL jobs and 300 slots for ad-hoc queries.
	2.	Run queries in both categories simultaneously.
	3.	Monitor slot allocation.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Slots from one reservation are not used by queries from the other reservation.

Test Case 5.2: Unassigned Slots
	•	Objective: Test behavior when reserved slots are not assigned to any workload.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Reserve 500 slots but do not assign them to any project.
	2.	Run queries across the organization.
	3.	Monitor slot usage.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Reserved slots remain idle, and on-demand slots are used instead.

6. Query Execution Tests

Test Case 6.1: Slot Scaling for Large Queries
	•	Objective: Verify that BigQuery dynamically scales slots for large queries.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Run a query that processes a large dataset (e.g., 1TB).
	2.	Monitor the number of slots allocated during execution.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	BigQuery scales up to 2,000 slots for the query if necessary.

Test Case 6.2: Small Query Efficiency
	•	Objective: Ensure that small queries use fewer slots efficiently.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Run a query on a small dataset (e.g., 1MB).
	2.	Monitor slot utilization.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Query uses minimal slots and executes quickly.

7. Monitoring and Logging Tests

Test Case 7.1: Slot Utilization Dashboard
	•	Objective: Verify that slot utilization metrics are correctly reported in Cloud Monitoring.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Run multiple queries.
	2.	Check slot utilization metrics in Cloud Monitoring.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Metrics accurately reflect the number of slots used and idle.

Test Case 7.2: Query Execution Logs
	•	Objective: Ensure that query logs capture slot usage details.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Run a complex query.
	2.	Check the query logs for slot allocation and execution details.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Logs provide detailed information about slot usage and query performance.

8. Cost Management Tests

Test Case 8.1: Cost Efficiency in Flat-Rate Mode
	•	Objective: Validate cost-effectiveness of reserved slots for predictable workloads.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Reserve 1,000 slots.
	2.	Run queries continuously over a month.
	3.	Compare the cost with on-demand pricing for the same workload.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Reserved slots result in lower costs for high query workloads.

Test Case 8.2: On-Demand Cost Control
	•	Objective: Ensure on-demand slot allocation does not exceed budget.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Set a budget alert in Cloud Billing.
	2.	Run heavy workloads in on-demand mode.
	3.	Monitor costs and slot usage.
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Budget alerts trigger appropriately, and slot allocation matches workload demand.

These test cases ensure that
