To test the 277CA (Claim Acknowledgement) file thoroughly, ensure you validate both Pharmacy (Pharm) and Claim tables as per the specific rules for the data. The following factors are crucial to ensure accurate testing:

General Validation Factors
	1.	File Format and Structure:
	•	Ensure the 277CA adheres to the ANSI X12 277CA standard format.
	•	Validate segment structure, delimiters, and overall compliance with the specification.
	2.	Provider and Payer Details:
	•	Confirm provider information matches with the source data (e.g., NPI, provider ID).
	•	Verify payer information, including payer ID and name, is correct.
	3.	Trace Numbers:
	•	Validate that the ICN (Internal Control Number) or Trace Number in the 277CA matches the claim submission.
	4.	Timestamps:
	•	Confirm the file contains appropriate timestamps for submission and processing.
	5.	Acknowledgment Codes:
	•	Validate the acknowledgment codes (e.g., A0, A1, A2) for each claim, indicating whether it was accepted, rejected, or partially accepted.
	6.	Rejection Codes:
	•	Test for accurate rejection reason codes (Status Category Codes and Status Codes) for rejected claims.
	•	Ensure these codes map correctly to the business rules and error descriptions.

Pharmacy (Pharm) Table Validation
	1.	NDC Validation:
	•	Ensure National Drug Code (NDC) values are correct and recognized.
	2.	Prescription Numbers:
	•	Cross-check prescription numbers between the claim and acknowledgment.
	3.	Pharmacy Identification:
	•	Validate the pharmacy NPI, name, and address.
	•	Confirm prescription fill dates and pharmacist IDs.
	4.	Billing Amounts:
	•	Test billing amounts, including drug cost, dispensing fee, and total claim amount.
	•	Verify adherence to pharmacy-specific billing rules (e.g., copay, coordination of benefits).
	5.	Adjudication Details:
	•	Check for approval/rejection of prescriptions based on formulary guidelines or prior authorization requirements.

Claim Table Validation
	1.	Claim Information:
	•	Ensure claim IDs and patient/member IDs are correctly transmitted and match with the source system.
	•	Validate that the claim date of service is correct.
	2.	Claim Amounts:
	•	Test the total billed amount, approved amount, and patient responsibility amounts.
	•	Ensure the monetary amounts are correctly mapped and calculated.
	3.	Diagnosis and Procedure Codes:
	•	Confirm ICD diagnosis codes and CPT/HCPCS procedure codes are accurate and valid.
	4.	Service Provider Validation:
	•	Validate service provider details (NPI, address, taxonomy code).
	5.	Patient Eligibility:
	•	Test for patient eligibility and enrollment data, ensuring coverage validity during the service date.
	6.	Rejection Reasons:
	•	Verify all rejection reasons, including:
	•	Invalid patient/member information.
	•	Invalid diagnosis or procedure codes.
	•	Missing or incorrect required fields.
	•	Duplicate claims.
	7.	Payment Indicators:
	•	Ensure the payment indicators in the acknowledgment file align with payer adjudication rules.

Cross-Table Testing
	1.	Data Consistency:
	•	Validate consistency of shared data between Pharm and Claim tables.
	•	For instance, check that the patient/member ID and provider ID match in both tables.
	2.	Claim Hierarchy:
	•	Confirm hierarchical relationships (e.g., claim header, service lines, and pharmacy items).
	3.	Duplicate Claims:
	•	Test for appropriate acknowledgment and rejection of duplicate claims from both Pharm and Claim sources.
	4.	Error Reporting:
	•	Ensure errors specific to pharmacy claims (e.g., NDC issues) are distinguished from errors specific to medical claims (e.g., invalid diagnosis).

Automation Considerations
	•	Batch Testing:
	•	Test 277CA files in bulk to ensure system performance and scalability.
	•	Boundary Cases:
	•	Validate edge cases such as:
	•	Zero-dollar claims.
	•	Rejected claims with multiple errors.
	•	Pharmacy claims with unusual formulary details.
	•	Reconciliation Testing:
	•	Ensure all claims submitted in the 837 file are acknowledged correctly in the 277CA.

By validating these factors across the Pharm and Claim tables, you can ensure that the 277CA file is accurate, complete,  
and aligned with business rules and regulatory requirements.


Cross-Table Testing Example: Verifying Consistency Between Pharmacy (Pharm) and Claim Tables

To ensure consistency between the Pharmacy (Pharm) and Claim tables, you need to validate shared data elements and relationships between the two datasets. Here’s an example to illustrate how to perform cross-table testing:

Scenario

You are testing a 277CA acknowledgment file for claims submitted from a healthcare provider. Claims include both pharmacy and medical services.

You want to ensure that the data in the Pharmacy table and Claim table is consistent for:
	1.	Patient ID
	2.	Claim Submission Date
	3.	Provider Information
	4.	Service Amounts
	5.	Rejection Reasons (if applicable)

Example Data

Pharmacy Table

Claim ID	Patient ID	Prescription Number	NDC Code	Provider NPI	Billed Amount	Service Date
123456789	P001	RX12345	1234567890	9876543210	150.00	2024-12-10
987654321	P002	RX67890	0987654321	1234567890	75.00	2024-12-11

Claim Table

Claim ID	Patient ID	Provider NPI	Diagnosis Code	Billed Amount	Service Date	Status
123456789	P001	9876543210	Z23	150.00	2024-12-10	A0
987654321	P002	1234567890	E11.9	75.00	2024-12-11	A1

Steps for Cross-Table Testing

1. Verify Patient Consistency
	•	Compare the Patient ID between the Pharm and Claim tables for the same Claim ID.
	•	For Claim ID 123456789, Patient ID matches as P001.
	•	For Claim ID 987654321, Patient ID matches as P002.

2. Match Claim Submission Dates
	•	Confirm the Service Date is the same in both tables.
	•	For Claim ID 123456789, Service Date is 2024-12-10 in both tables.
	•	For Claim ID 987654321, Service Date is 2024-12-11 in both tables.

3. Validate Provider Details
	•	Check if the Provider NPI matches between the Pharm and Claim tables for the same Claim ID.
	•	For Claim ID 123456789, Provider NPI matches as 9876543210.
	•	For Claim ID 987654321, Provider NPI matches as 1234567890.

4. Reconcile Billed Amounts
	•	Verify that the Billed Amount is consistent across both tables for the same Claim ID.
	•	For Claim ID 123456789, Billed Amount matches as $150.00.
	•	For Claim ID 987654321, Billed Amount matches as $75.00.

5. Check Acknowledgment Status
	•	Validate the acknowledgment status (Status Code) in the Claim table.
	•	For Claim ID 123456789, Status is A0 (Accepted).
	•	For Claim ID 987654321, Status is A1 (Partially Accepted).

6. Validate Rejection Reasons (if applicable)
	•	If a claim is rejected, confirm the rejection reason is consistent across the Pharm and Claim tables.
	•	For Claim ID 987654321, assume the rejection is due to a formulary issue. Ensure the rejection appears in both tables and matches the rejection code from the 277CA acknowledgment file.

Expected Outcome
	1.	All shared fields (Patient ID, Service Date, Provider NPI, Billed Amount) match between the Pharm and Claim tables for each Claim ID.
	2.	Acknowledgment statuses and rejection reasons are correctly reflected in both tables.
	3.	Discrepancies (e.g., mismatched patient IDs, service dates, or billed amounts) are flagged for investigation.

Automation Opportunity

For automation:
	•	Use SQL or a testing tool to join the Pharmacy and Claim tables on Claim ID.
	•	Write queries to compare shared fields and output mismatches for further review.

SQL Example

SELECT 
    p.ClaimID, 
    p.PatientID AS PharmPatientID, 
    c.PatientID AS ClaimPatientID,
    p.ServiceDate AS PharmServiceDate, 
    c.ServiceDate AS ClaimServiceDate,
    p.ProviderNPI AS PharmProviderNPI, 
    c.ProviderNPI AS ClaimProviderNPI,
    p.BilledAmount AS PharmBilledAmount, 
    c.BilledAmount AS ClaimBilledAmount
FROM 
    PharmacyTable p
INNER JOIN 
    ClaimTable c
ON 
    p.ClaimID = c.ClaimID
WHERE 
    p.PatientID <> c.PatientID
    OR p.ServiceDate <> c.ServiceDate
    OR p.ProviderNPI <> c.ProviderNPI
    OR p.BilledAmount <> c.BilledAmount;

This query identifies inconsistencies across the Pharmacy and Claim tables for critical fields.

By performing these checks, you ensure that the 277CA acknowledgment file accurately reflects the data and relationships between the pharmacy and claim datasets.




As part of the process, I am raising a database request that follows a similar format across all projects, with the only variation being the database name. Below are sample requests, which include tickets related to Autosys and the Insomnia tool. I have reached out to the respective ticket owners to obtain access. I hope this information is helpful.
